    "### Question 1: What is the difference between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics? Explain with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Descriptive Statistics**  \n",
    "- Definition: Methods used to summarize, organize, and describe the main features of a dataset.  \n",
    "- They do not make predictions or generalizations beyond the data.  \n",
    "- Focus is on presenting information in a simple form (tables, graphs, averages, percentages).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**  \n",
    "- A teacher calculates the average marks of her class.  \n",
    "- A company summarizes its employees’ age distribution.  \n",
    "- A cricket player’s batting average across 10 matches.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Inferential Statistics**  \n",
    "- Definition: Methods used to make predictions, inferences, or generalizations about a population based on a sample.  \n",
    "- Uses probability, hypothesis testing, and estimation.  \n",
    "- Involves uncertainty and confidence levels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**  \n",
    "- A political survey of 1,000 voters is used to predict the outcome for millions.  \n",
    "- A scientist tests a drug on a sample group to infer its effectiveness.  \n",
    "- A company uses one branch’s sales data to predict company-wide performance."

    "### Question 2: What is sampling in statistics? Explain the differences between random and stratified sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Sampling is selecting a subset (sample) from a population to study and make conclusions about the population.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Sampling?**  \n",
    "- Studying the whole population is impractical.  \n",
    "- A properly chosen sample can provide reliable insights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Sampling:**  \n",
    "- Every member has an equal chance of selection.  \n",
    "- Methods: lottery system, random number generator.  \n",
    "- Advantage: Simple, unbiased if done properly.  \n",
    "- Limitation: May not represent all subgroups equally.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Stratified Sampling:**  \n",
    "- Population divided into subgroups (strata) based on characteristics (gender, income, etc.).  \n",
    "- Samples are randomly taken from each subgroup proportionally.  \n",
    "- Advantage: Ensures representation of all key groups.  \n",
    "- Limitation: More complex to organize."

    "- **Mean:** The sum of all values divided by the number of values.  \n",
    "  Example: (5+10+15+20)/4 = 12.5  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Median:** The middle value when data is ordered.  \n",
    "  Example: Data [6,8,10,12] → Median = (8+10)/2 = 9  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mode:** The value occurring most frequently.  \n",
    "  Example: [2,4,4,6,6,6,8] → Mode = 6  \n",
